      <h3>Monil Hiteshkumar</h3>
      <p>I'm a first-year computer science student curretly studying at City University. 
        Prior to starting University, I did computer science for one of my A-Levels at 
        sixth form alongside Maths and Physics. We primarily coded in python, but we 
        learn a few concepts in HTML, CSS and Java.For my coursework I also developed a
         3-level shooting game using Object-Orientated Programming.   </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: 2D Solar System Animation</h3>
    <p>
    This is the first project that I've created during the first 2 weeks at Bootcamp.
    Over those two weeks, I've learnt many new things about programming and tried to
    implement as many things as I could in my own work. My project is based around 
    one of the lectures about classes and objects. My project is about a 2D visual 
    representation of our solar system. I used a planet-class to store all the code
    related to each planet, so  and how they will move and where they would be created.
    Each planet moves along its own orbital path at various speeds. The year counter
    of each planet increased every time it completes one whole orbit. I've also made
    it user interactive by adding a key that the user can press to show and hide planet names.
